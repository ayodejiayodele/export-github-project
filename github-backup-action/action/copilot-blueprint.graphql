Technically, it's easy for users to access Copilot, but may lead to a suboptimal first experience without proper guidance.\n- **Team by Team:** Offers more structured planning and guidance, enhancing the initial experience and effectiveness of Copilot integration.\n\nWe recommend evaluating these strategies to determine which aligns best with your organizational needs and culture. it's beneficial to consider how other organizations have successfully adopted it. By analyzing case studies of customers who have implemented Copilot, we can create a strategic roadmap to maximize its utility. These case studies often reveal best practices for deployment, team adaptation, and the enhancement of coding standards, ultimately leading to a significant boost in productivity and code quality.\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [ ] **Build your organization's GitHub Copilot adoption plan**\n- [ ] Understand the impact of GitHub Copilot on developer productivity and code quality through quantitative and qualitative research.\n- [ ] Analyze case studies from organizations like Duolingo that have successfully integrated GitHub Copilot to enforce code consistency and accelerate developer speed.\n- [ ] Investigate the specific benefits reported by companies, such as the increase in developer speed and the decrease in code review turnaround time.\n- [ ] Consider how GitHub Copilot can be leveraged as a force multiplier for expertise within your own organization.\n- [ ] Examine how GitHub Copilot can help in scaling the underlying technology for a new future of software development.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Research: Quantifying GitHub Copilot’s impact on developer productivity](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) - This resource provides research findings on how GitHub Copilot affects developer productivity.\n- [Duolingo's GitHub Copilot Success Story](https://github.com/customer-stories/duolingo) - Read about how Duolingo used GitHub Copilot and Codespaces to empower their engineers and increase efficiency.\n- [GitHub Universe 2023: Copilot transforms GitHub into the AI-powered developer platform](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/) - Information on how GitHub Copilot is part of GitHub's vision for the future of software development.\n\nThese resources will provide insights into the practical application and benefits of GitHub Copilot from a strategic and operational perspective, aiding in the creation of a roadmap for its implementation within your team or organization.\n",

This method is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n\nSpecifically, there are two ways to tailor the output of GitHub Copilot to your context. One is by providing your context through prompts to the pre-trained model, and the other is by fine-tuning the model itself. Using RAG with pre-trained model to improve the accuracy of prompts and suggestions is currently gaining attention, and this personalization has been incorporated into Copilot Enterprise.\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [ ] Identify areas where the accuracy of GitHub Copilot could be improved further or where higher accuracy would be beneficial. For instance, scenarios with large codebases where grasping the big picture is challenging, cases with insufficient code documentation, or instances with extensive documentation that are difficult to search through.\n- [ ] Identify the GitHub organizations which have these challenges?

Fine-tuning might be the solution you need. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the model to improve its accuracy. This can be achieved by adding your GitHub repositories to the pre-trained model and customizing the model itself. If you have specific naming conventions or other coding styles, fine-tuning could potentially make code generation more accurate by providing the necessary context. It can also be valuable for languages with less open-source information, i.e., areas where the base model might not have learned much, or when you want to add specific version-related information for more accurate suggestions.\n\nHowever, the training requires adding an addon to Copilot Enterprise. Understand that accuracy improvements might be limited to certain areas. Fine-tuning is a powerful feature that can yield significant results depending on the workload, but consider strategically trying fine-tuning with this in mind.\n\n## Checklist \n\n- [ ] Identify technical areas where Copilot's code completion accuracy should be improved.\n- [ ] Consider alternatives to fine-tuning for improving accuracy. This includes refining prompt engineering, adding natural language context to the codebase, and using RAG for accuracy enhancement. If these are insufficient, or if you need higher accuracy for generating a large volume of source code with GitHub Copilot, consider fine-tuning.\n- [ ] Determine the necessary projects and specific repositories to include for fine-tuning.\n- [ ] Implement fine-tuning and verify the improvements in accuracy.\n\n## Useful resources\n\n- [Universe 2023: Copilot transforms GitHub into the AI-powered developer platform](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/)\n",
